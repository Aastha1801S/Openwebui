I heard there's a new art museum exhibit that just opened up downtown, and I thought it would be really cool to check it out together. We could make a day out of it, grab brunch afterwards, and then maybe even catch a movie or have dinner at that new restaurant we've been wanting to try. What do you think?\n",
